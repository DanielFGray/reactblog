# reactblog

Because writing your blog as a single page application is fun!

## features

* a custom static generator that transforms markdown into json containing the "compiled" html with syntax highlighting
* a React front-end based on my [react-starter](https://gitlab.com/danielfgray/react-starter)

## roadmap

* non-blog post items in nav
* some sort of global menu
  * tag list
  * other forms of contact, eg social media
* pre-compile all pages into HTML
